-@node Fast Full Name Search
-@subsection Fast Full Name Search
-
-To search for files by name without having to actually scan the
-directories on the disk (which can be slow), you can use the
-@code{locate} program.  For each shell pattern you give it,
-@code{locate} searches one or more databases of file names and
-displays the file names that contain the pattern.  @xref{Shell Pattern
-Matching}, for details about shell patterns.
-
-If a pattern is a plain string---it contains no
-metacharacters---@code{locate} displays all file names in the database
-that contain that string.  If a pattern contains
-metacharacters, @code{locate} only displays file names that match the
-pattern exactly.  As a result, patterns that contain metacharacters
-should usually begin with a @samp{*}, and will most often end with one
-as well.  The exceptions are patterns that are intended to explicitly
-match the beginning or end of a file name.
-
-If you only want @code{locate} to match against the last component of
-the file names (the ``base name'' of the files) you can use the
-@samp{--basename} option.  The opposite behaviour is the default, but
-can be selected explicitly by using the option @samp{--wholename}.
-
-The command
-@example
-locate @var{pattern}
-@end example
-
-is almost equivalent to
-@example
-find @var{directories} -name @var{pattern}
-@end example
-
-where @var{directories} are the directories for which the file name
-databases contain information.  The differences are that the
-@code{locate} information might be out of date, and that @code{locate}
-handles wildcards in the pattern slightly differently than @code{find}
-(@pxref{Shell Pattern Matching}).
-
-The file name databases contain lists of files that were on the system
-when the databases were last updated.  The system administrator can
-choose the file name of the default database, the frequency with which
-the databases are updated, and the directories for which they contain
-entries.
-

-@node LOCATE02 Database Format
-@subsection LOCATE02 Database Format
-
-@code{updatedb} runs a program called @code{frcode} to
-@dfn{front-compress} the list of file names, which reduces the
-database size by a factor of 4 to 5.  Front-compression (also known as
-incremental encoding) works as follows.
-
-The database entries are a sorted list (case-insensitively, for users'
-convenience).  Since the list is sorted, each entry is likely to share
-a prefix (initial string) with the previous entry.  Each database
-entry begins with an offset-differential count byte, which is the
-additional number of characters of prefix of the preceding entry to
-use beyond the number that the preceding entry is using of its
-predecessor.  (The counts can be negative.)  Following the count is a
-null-terminated ASCII remainder---the part of the name that follows
-the shared prefix.
-
-If the offset-differential count is larger than can be stored in a
-byte (+/-127), the byte has the value 0x80 and the count follows in a
-2-byte word, with the high byte first (network byte order).
-
-Every database begins with a dummy entry for a file called
-@file{LOCATE02}, which @code{locate} checks for to ensure that the
-database file has the correct format; it ignores the entry in doing
-the search.
-
-Databases cannot be concatenated together, even if the first (dummy)
-entry is trimmed from all but the first database.  This is because the
-offset-differential count in the first entry of the second and
-following databases will be wrong.
-
-In the output of @samp{locate --statistics}, the new database format
-is referred to as @samp{LOCATE02}.

-@node slocate Database Format
-@subsection slocate Database Format
-
-The @code{slocate} program uses a database format similar to, but not
-quite the same as, GNU @code{locate}.  The first byte of the database
-specifies its @dfn{security level}.  If the security level is 0,
-@code{slocate} will read, match and print filenames on the basis of
-the information in the database only.  However, if the security level
-byte is 1, @code{slocate} omits entries from its output if the
-invoking user is unable to access them.  The second byte of the
-database is zero.  The second byte is immediately followed by the
-first database entry.  The first entry in the database is not preceded
-by any differential count or dummy entry.  Instead the differential
-count for the first item is assumed to be zero.
-.P
-Starting with the second entry (if any) in the database, data is
-interpreted as for the GNU LOCATE02 format.
-
-@node Old Database Format
-@subsection Old Database Format
-
-The old database format is used by Unix @code{locate} and @code{find}
-programs and earlier releases of the GNU ones.  @code{updatedb}
-produces this format if given the @samp{--old-format} option.
-
-@code{updatedb} runs programs called @code{bigram} and @code{code} to
-produce old-format databases.  The old format differs from the new one
-in the following ways.  Instead of each entry starting with an
-offset-differential count byte and ending with a null, byte values
-from 0 through 28 indicate offset-differential counts from -14 through
-14.  The byte value indicating that a long offset-differential count
-follows is 0x1e (30), not 0x80.  The long counts are stored in host
-byte order, which is not necessarily network byte order, and host
-integer word size, which is usually 4 bytes.  They also represent a
-count 14 less than their value.  The database lines have no
-termination byte; the start of the next line is indicated by its first
-byte having a value <= 30.
-
-In addition, instead of starting with a dummy entry, the old database
-format starts with a 256 byte table containing the 128 most common
-bigrams in the file list.  A bigram is a pair of adjacent bytes.
-Bytes in the database that have the high bit set are indexes (with the
-high bit cleared) into the bigram table.  The bigram and
-offset-differential count coding makes these databases 20-25% smaller
-than the new format, but makes them not 8-bit clean.  Any byte in a
-file name that is in the ranges used for the special codes is replaced
-in the database by a question mark, which not coincidentally is the
-shell wildcard to match a single character.
-
-The old format therefore cannot faithfully store entries with
-non-ASCII characters. It therefore should not be used in
-internationalised environments.  That is, most installations should
-not use it.
-
-Because the long counts are stored by the @code{code} program as
-native-order machine words, the database format is not eaily used in
-environments which differ in terms of byte order.  If locate databases
-are to be shared between machines, the LOCATE02 database format should
-be used.  This has other benefits as discussed above.  However, the
-length of the filename currently being processed can normally be used
-to place reasonable limits on the long counts and so this information
-is used by locate to help it guess the byte ordering of the old format
-database.  Unless it finds evidence to the contrary, @code{locate}
-will assume that the byte order of the database is the same as the
-native byte order of the machine running @code{locate}.  The output of
-@samp{locate --statistics} also includes information about the byte
-order of old-format databases.
-
-The output of @samp{locate --statistics} will give an incorrect count
-of the number of file names containing newlines or high-bit characters
-for old-format databases.
-
-Old versions of GNU @code{locate} fail to correctly handle very long
-file names, possibly leading to security problems relating to a heap
-buffer overrun.  @xref{Security Considerations for locate}, for a
-detailed explanation.
-
-@node Newline Handling
-@section Newline Handling
-
-Within the database, file names are terminated with a null character.
-This is the case for both the old and the new format.
-
-When the new database format is being used, the compression technique
-used to generate the database though relies on the ability to sort the
-list of files before they are presented to @code{frcode}.
-
-If the system's sort command allows its input list of files to be
-separated with null characters via the @samp{-z} option, this option
-is used and therefore @code{updatedb} and @code{locate} will both
-correctly handle file names containing newlines.  If the @code{sort}
-command lacks support for this, the list of files is delimited with
-the newline character, meaning that parts of file names containing
-newlines will be incorrectly sorted.  This can result in both
-incorrect matches and incorrect failures to match.
-
-On the other hand, if you are using the old database format, file
-names with embedded newlines are not correctly handled.  There is no
-technical limitation which enforces this, it's just that the
-@code{bigram} program has not been updated to support lists of file
-names separated by nulls.
-
-So, if you are using the new database format (this is the default) and
-your system uses GNU @code{sort}, newlines will be correctly handled
-at all times.  Otherwise, newlines may not be correctly handled.

-It is fairly unusual for the output of @code{locate} to be fed into

-Although the problems relating to whitespace in file names can be

-the race condition problems associated with @samp{find @dots{} -print0}.
-There is no way to avoid these problems in the case of @code{locate}.
-
-@subsection Long File Name Bugs with Old-Format Databases
-Old versions of @code{locate} have a bug in the way that old-format
-databases are read.  This bug affects the following versions of
-@code{locate}:
-
-@enumerate
-@item All releases prior to 4.2.31
-@item All 4.3.x releases prior to 4.3.7
-@end enumerate
-
-The affected versions of @code{locate} read file names into a
-fixed-length 1026 byte buffer, allocated on the heap.  This buffer is
-not extended if file names are too long to fit into the buffer.  No
-range checking on the length of the filename is performed.  This could
-in theory lead to a privilege escalation attack.  Findutils versions
-4.3.0 to 4.3.6 are also affected.
-
-On systems using the old database format and affected versions of
-@code{locate}, carefully-chosen long file names could in theory allow
-malicious users to run code of their choice as any user invoking
-locate.
-
-If remote users can choose the names of files stored on your system,
-and these files are indexed by @code{updatedb}, this may be a remote
-security vulnerability.  Findutils version 4.2.31 and findutils
-version 4.3.7 include fixes for this problem.  The @code{updatedb},
-@code{bigram} and @code{code} programs do no appear to be affected.
-
-If you are also using GNU coreutils, you can use the following command
-to determine the length of the longest file name on a given system:
-
-@example
-find / -print0 | tr -c '\0' 'x' | tr '\0' '\n' | wc -L
-@end example
-
-Although this problem is significant, the old database format is not
-the default, and use of the old database format is not common.  Most
-installations and most users will not be affected by this problem.

-@item warning: database @file{@value{LOCATE_DB}} is more than 8 days old
-The @code{locate} program relies on a database which is periodically
-built by the @code{updatedb} program.  That hasn't happened in a long
-time.  To fix this problem, run @code{updatedb} manually.  This can
-often happen on systems that are generally not left on, so the

-and @code{updatedb --version}.  These should produce the same output.
-If not, you are using a mixed toolset; check your @samp{$PATH}
